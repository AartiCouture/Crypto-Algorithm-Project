# Crypto-Algorithm-Project
Project 2
### Description
We are creating an algorithmic trading bot to predict the future price of Bitcoin and Ethereum using back data.  We will be using machine learning models to test the back data and the classification report to evaluate our models.  We will use QuantConnect to create our algorithm. 
## Research Question 
Is a trading bot a more efficient way to predict Cryptocurrency prices for the future?  Will it help make trading Cryptocurrency more predicitible? 
## Datasets/Models 
We are using historical data for Bitcoin and Ethereum from Bitfinex and then training a NeuralNetworkAlgorithm to create trades based on the backtested data.  We are using the LSTM and Dense model to backtest the data. 
## Task Breakdown
